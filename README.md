# AIMLProjects
Implementing ML/AI algorithms, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP) and knowledge graphs and feature stores.

Once you set up python environment and openAI, you should be able to run this program locally. Additioanlly you can expose this as a API and develop a front end to run the "risk" service

Custom Prompt: To assess the risk for a home insurance policy on a coastal property, please provide the following information:

1. Exact distance from the coastline
2. Elevation above sea level
3. Construction materials used (e.g., wood frame, concrete, steel)
4. Roof type and age
5. Presence and type of storm shutters or impact-resistant windows
6. Flood zone designation
7. History of natural disasters in the area (hurricanes, floods, etc.)
8. Local building codes and compliance status
9. Presence of seawall or other coastal protection measures
10. Insurance claim history for the property and surrounding area

Please provide as much detail as possible for each point to ensure an accurate risk assessment.

AI Assessment: Based on the submission data provided, here's an assessment of the insurance risk for the coastal property:

1. Location Risk: High - The property's coastal location exposes it to increased risks from storms, flooding, and erosion.

2. Property Age: Moderate - Built in 1995, the home is neither new nor very old. It may have some wear but is likely built to more modern standards than older properties.

3. Size: Moderate - At 2500 square feet, this is a substantial property, which could mean higher replacement costs in case of damage.

4. Previous Claims: Low to Moderate - With only one previous claim, the property doesn't have a extensive history of issues. However, the nature and severity of that claim would be important to consider.

5. Construction Quality: Unknown - More information is needed about the building materials and techniques used, especially considering the coastal location.

6. Natural Disaster Preparedness: Unknown - Information about flood protection, wind resistance, and other mitigation measures is crucial for a coastal property.

Overall Risk Assessment: Moderate to High

The property's coastal location is the primary factor elevating the risk. While the limited claim history is positive, the age and size of the property could lead to significant costs in case of damage. To provide a more accurate assessment, additional information about construction quality, specific location details (elevation, distance from shore), and disaster preparedness measures would be necessary.

Recommendations:
1. Conduct a thorough inspection to assess the property's resilience to coastal hazards.
2. Consider requiring or incentivizing the installation of storm shutters or impact-resistant windows.
3. Verify compliance with current building codes for coastal properties.
4. Recommend a flood insurance policy in addition to standard homeowners insurance.
5. Suggest a wind mitigation inspection to identify potential areas for improvement in the property's wind resistance.

Predicted Risk Level: Medium Risk

Loss Assessment: Based on the insurance submission data for the coastal single-family home, here's an assessment of potential losses and risk scenarios:

1. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Damage:
   - High risk due to coastal location
   - Potential for significant structural damage from high winds and flying debris
   - Estimated loss range: $100,000 - $500,000 depending on storm severity

2. Flood Damage:
   - Moderate to high risk, especially if property is in a low-lying area
   - Potential for water damage to first floor and foundation
   - Estimated loss range: $50,000 - $250,000

3. Storm Surge:
   - High risk due to coastal proximity
   - Potential for severe structural damage and total loss in extreme cases
   - Estimated loss range: $200,000 - full property value

4. Wind Damage:
   - Moderate risk, may be mitigated by building age (potentially built to more recent codes)
   - Potential for roof damage, broken windows, and water infiltration
   - Estimated loss range: $20,000 - $100,000

5. Erosion:
   - Long-term risk that could affect property stability
   - Potential for foundation issues and decreased property value
   - Estimated loss range: $10,000 - $50,000 annually in property value

6. Lightning Strikes:
   - Moderate risk
   - Potential for fire damage and electrical system issues
   - Estimated loss range: $5,000 - $50,000

Risk Mitigation Recommendations:
1. Install storm shutters or impact-resistant windows
2. Elevate critical systems and utilities
3. Implement proper drainage systems
4. Regular roof inspections and maintenance
5. Consider additional flood barriers or seawall if not already present

Insurance Considerations:
1. Ensure adequate coverage for full replacement cost
2. Consider separate flood insurance policy
3. Evaluate need for additional riders for specific coastal risks
4. Implement a detailed home inventory for accurate claims processing

Regular reassessment of these risks and mitigation strategies is recommended due to the dynamic nature of coastal environments and climate change impacts.
